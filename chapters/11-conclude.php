		<h2>Summary and Conclusion</h2>
		<p>We have provided a comprehensive introduction to knowledge graphs, which have been receiving more and more attention in recent years. Under the definition of a knowledge graph as <em>a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities</em>, we have discussed models by which data can be structured as graphs; representations of schema, identity and context; techniques for leveraging deductive and inductive knowledge; methods for the creation, enrichment, quality assessment and refinement of knowledge graphs; principles and standards for publishing knowledge graphs; and finally, the adoption of knowledge graphs in the real world.</p>
		<p><em class="paragraph">Future directions</em>. Research on knowledge graphs can become a confluence of techniques arising from different areas with the common objective of maximising the knowledge – and thus value – that can be distilled from diverse sources at large scale using a graph-based data abstraction&nbsp;<? echo $references->cite("Hogan20"); ?>. Pursuing this objective will benefit from expertise on graph databases, knowledge representation, logic, machine learning, graph algorithms and theory, ontology engineering, data quality, natural language processing, information extraction, privacy and security, and more besides.</p>
		<p>While advances in these individual disciplines are sure to continue and to generate further impact, particularly interesting topics arise also from their intersections. In the intersection of data graphs and deductive knowledge, we emphasise emerging topics such as <em>formal semantics for property graphs</em>, with languages that can take into account the meaning of labels and property–value pairs on nodes and edges&nbsp;<? echo $references->cite("Krotzsch0OT18"); ?>; and <em>reasoning and querying over contextual data</em>, in order to derive conclusions and results valid in a particular setting&nbsp;<? echo $references->cite("SerafiniH12,zimm-etal-2012-JWS,SchuetzBNSS20"); ?>. In the intersection of data graphs and inductive knowledge, we highlight topics such as <em>similarity-based query relaxation</em>, allowing to find approximate answers to exact queries based on numerical representations (e.g., embeddings)&nbsp;<? echo $references->cite("WangWLCZQ18"); ?>; <em>shape induction</em>, in order to extract and formalise inherent patterns in the knowledge graph as constraints&nbsp;<? echo $references->cite("Mihindukulasooriya18"); ?>; and <em>contextual knowledge graph embeddings</em> that provide numeric representations of nodes and edges that vary with time, place, etc.&nbsp;<? echo $references->cite("KazemiGJKSFP19"); ?>. Finally, in the intersection of deductive and inductive knowledge, we mention the topics of <em>entailment-aware knowledge graph embeddings</em>&nbsp;<? echo $references->cite("GuoWWWG16,DemeesterRR16"); ?>, that incorporate rules and/or ontologies when computing plausibility; <em>expressive graph neural networks</em> proven capable of complex classification analogous to expressive ontology languages&nbsp;<? echo $references->cite("BarceloKMPRS20"); ?>; as well as further advances on <em>rule and axiom mining</em>, allowing to extract symbolic, deductive representations from the knowledge graphs&nbsp;<? echo $references->cite("GalarragaTHS15,BuhmannLW16"); ?>.</p>
		<p>Aside from specific topics, more general challenges for knowledge graphs include <em>scalability</em>, particularly for deductive and inductive reasoning; <em>quality</em>, not only in terms of data, but also the models induced from knowledge graphs; <em>diversity</em>, such as managing contextual or multi-modal data; <em>dynamicity</em>, considering temporal or streaming data; and finally <em>usability</em>, which is key to increasing adoption. Though techniques are continuously being proposed to address precisely these challenges, they are unlikely to ever be completely “solved”; rather they serve as dimensions along which knowledge graphs, and their techniques, tools, etc., will continue to mature.</p>
		<p>Given the availability of open knowledge graphs whose quality continue to improve, as well as the growing adoption of enterprise knowledge graphs in various industries, future research on knowledge graphs has the potential to foster key advancements in broad aspects of society. Here we have highlighted just some examples of future research directions of importance to this pursuit.</p>
