    abstract = {We describe a generic framework for representing and reasoning with annotated Semantic Web data, a task becoming more important with the recent increased amount of inconsistent and non-reliable meta-data on the web. We formalise the annotated language, the corresponding deductive system and address the query answering problem. Previous contributions on specific RDF annotation domains are encompassed by our unified reasoning formalism as we show by instantiating it on (i) temporal, (ii) fuzzy, and (iii) provenance annotations. Moreover, we provide a generic method for combining multiple annotation domains allowing to represent, e.g., temporally-annotated fuzzy RDF. Furthermore, we address the development of a query language -- AnQL -- that is inspired by SPARQL, including several features of SPARQL 1.1 (subqueries, aggregates, assignment, solution modifiers) along with the formal definitions of their semantics.},

    pages = {190--207},
    abstract = {Vector space embeddings have been shown to perform well when using RDF data in data mining and machine learning tasks. Existing approaches, such as RDF2Vec, use local information, i.e., they rely on local sequences generated for nodes in the RDF graph. For word embeddings, global techniques, such as GloVe, have been proposed as an alternative. In this paper, we show how the idea of global embeddings can be transferred to RDF embeddings, and show that the results are competitive with traditional local techniques like RDF2Vec.},

    abstract = {Linked Open Data has been recognized as a valuable source for background information in data mining. However, most data mining tools require features in propositional form, i.e., a vector of nominal or numerical features associated with an instance, while Linked Open Data sources are graphs by nature. In this paper, we present RDF2Vec, an approach that uses language modeling approaches for unsupervised feature extraction from sequences of words, and adapts them to RDF graphs. We generate sequences by leveraging local information from graph sub-structures, harvested by Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtree RDF Graph Kernels and graph walks, and learn latent numerical representations of entities in RDF graphs. Our evaluation shows that such vector representations outperform existing techniques for the propositionalization of RDF graphs on a variety of different predictive machine learning tasks, and that feature vector representations of general knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and Wikidata can be easily reused for different tasks.},

    abstract = {The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}
