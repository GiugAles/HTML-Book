# KG Book in HTML

This is the repository where we put the sources for the [HTML version of the book *Knowledge Graphs*](https://kgbook.org/) by Hogan et al.
The book is itself an extended version of [the technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02320) with the same title and authors.
There is also an [HTML version of the technical report](https://www.emse.fr/~zimmermann/KG).

The HTML version was generated from PHP scripts, regex search replace, and a lot of perspiration. The bibliography is partly generated using [bibtexbrowser](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/bibtexbrowser/), a PHP library by Martin Monperrus available under the GNU General Public License. The math formulas are generated from LaTeX code using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), a JavaScript libray available under the MIT License. The syntax highlight for HTML in [Figure&nbsp;6.2](https://kgbook.org/#fig-html) and the BibTeX code in the bibliography and the preamble are rendered using [Prism](https://prismjs.com/), a JavaScript library under the MIT License. The BibTeX file used for the bibliography was made by the authors. Most figures are in Scalable Vector Graphic, generated from [Ti*k*Z](https://pgf-tikz.github.io/) figures used in the LaTeX version of the technical report. All other PHP scripts, CSS, HTML files were created by [Antoine Zimmermann](https://w3id.org/people/az/cv). The picture at the top of the HTML page uses the background image of the book cover from Morgan & Claypool (used with authorisation) on which is added text in HTML with hyperlinks to the [authors' biographies](https://kgbook.org/#sec-bio).
